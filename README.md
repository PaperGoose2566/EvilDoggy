So there's normal people called townsfolk and then there is an evil dog (rawr) who kills all the townsfolk and is evil and secret (shhh).

This is just like Freddy Fivebear, who is an animationmatronic in Freddy Fivebear Pizza with his friends Chicago Kitchen, Bonnie the Bonniebun, Foxy the Foxpirate (Rawr) and Freddy Fivebear goes aur aur auraur aur aurauraurauraur and he bites children because he was killed by William Afton wearing a yellow Bonniebunbun suit which is just like Bonniebun but yellow. Then he put the children's souls inside of animationmatronics and because the soul is in their bodies the children's bodies are in the animationmatronics. And so then they hate William Aftermath and in 1983 one of the animationmatronics bites a child (chomp chomp) and then Markiplier goes "was that the bite of '87" but no, that was the bite of '83 and so the animationmatronic becomes destroyed and is turned into mangle who looks like Foxy the Foxpirate (rawr) but is a girl and also scary. Then in 1987 a different animationmatronic bites a different child (chomp) and then the Freddy Fivebear Pizza is closed because they eat children, Then the animationmatronics get revenge on William Aftermath and put him in the yellow Bonniebonbun suit and he dies and he also becomes an animationmatronic. Much later the Freddy Fivebear Fright Pizza is opened and William Aftermath is an animationmatronic in that Pizza and then he is called Springtrap because the yellow Bonbun suit had springlocks and that killed William Aftermath so now he's called Springtrap. William Afton's son, Michael Afton then works as a security guard in Freddy Fivebear Fright and William Afton is angry because Michael Aftermath was the security guard at Freddy Fivebear Pizza so he tries to kill Michael Afton but then Fivebear Frights burns and William Aftermath in his yellow bonniebun suit burns with the Pizza and then he is the dead and the other kids' souls leave the animationmatronics until that is retconned later (I think idk I forgor the rest)
